Hello everyone. I'm Iván González, from Colombia. I hade a Bsc in Ecology and almost a Msc in Hydrology, both from Xaverian University in my country. Now I'm pursuing a PhD in Ecoinformatics. This is my second year. I also want to determine the effects of forest loss on water related ecosystem services.
